# Adam's git configuration files and utilities

This is my collection of configuration files and utilities for
[git](http://git-scm.com/).

## CONTENTS

Contents include:

### Upstream branch status reporting / management

* [`git-upstream`](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/blob/master/bin/git-upstream) - obtain the upstream tracking branch (N.B. depends on `git-head`, `git-root`, and `git-prefix`)
* [`git-set-upstream`](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/blob/master/bin/git-set-upstream) - set the upstream tracking branch (N.B. depends on `git-head` and `git-root`)
* [`git-compare-upstream`](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/blob/master/bin/git-compare-upstream) - set the upstream tracking branch (N.B. depends on `git-head` and `git-upstream`, and hence also on `git-root` and and `git-prefix`)
* [`git-wip`](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/blob/master/bin/git-wip) - returns true if the current repo has any work in progress, i.e. commits out of sync with upstream, or unmodified/untracked files

### History rewriting

* [`git-rewrite-author`](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/blob/master/bin/git-rewrite-author) - rewrite the author for a range of commits
* [`git-rewrite-committer`](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/blob/master/bin/git-rewrite-committer) - rewrite the committer for a range of commits
* [`git-sed-range`](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/blob/master/bin/git-sed-range) - run a sed script over every log message in a range of commits

### Management of remotes

* [`git-url-rewrite`](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/blob/master/bin/git-url-rewrite) - convenient interface for setting [git URL rewrites via `url.$url.insteadOf`](http://qa-rockstar.livejournal.com/9961.html)

### Mapping files/blobs back to commits

* [`git-ls-dir`](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/blob/master/bin/git-ls-dir) - list files in a git repo tree together with the commits which most recently touched them.
* [`git-find-blob`](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/blob/master/bin/git-find-blob) - find which commits contain a given (non-abbreviated) blob

### Helper scripts

Little shell wrappers to make the git porcelain and higher-level scripts a little more beautiful.

* [`git-head`](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/blob/master/bin/git-head) - obtain the current branch
* [`git-root`](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/blob/master/bin/git-root) - obtain the absolute path to the root (top-level) directory of the repository we're currently in
* [`git-prefix`](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/blob/master/bin/git-prefix) - obtain the current directory path relative to the root (top-level) directory of the repository
* [`git-cdup`](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/blob/master/bin/git-cdup) - obtain the relative path from the current directory to the root (top-level) directory of the repository

### Shorthand wrappers

* [`gg*`](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/tree/master/bin/) - a whole bunch of wrappers around standard git commands to reduce the number of keystrokes required and add a little bit of polish to the interface here and there

### ... and more!

There are many other handy utilities - feel free to [browse the `bin/` directory](https://github.com/aspiers/git-config/tree/master/bin)!

## INSTALLATION

This repository is designed to be
[stowed](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) directly into your home
directory:

    git clone git://github.com/aspiers/git-config.git
    stow -d . -t ~ git-config

However if you only want to cherry-pick bits and pieces then you can
easily just copy or symlink them in manually.  Just be aware that some
of the files depend on other files, some of which are in this
