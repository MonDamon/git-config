# Wrapper around any command (or wrapper) which appends "^!" to the
# last argument.  This is useful when you have a list of SHA1 digests
# and you want to feed each one to a git log command and only get
# output for that commit.  In some cases this is better than simply
# using "-1", since it lets you eliminate output from commits which
# don't affect a certain file, e.g.
#
#     git log -1 $sha -- $path
#
# will always output something, even if $sha doesn't touch $path,
# whereas
#
#     gg1s git log $sha -- $path
#
# won't.  So you can do stuff like
#
#     git cherry ... | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -i gg1s git log {} -- $path
#
# to see all commits touching $path which haven't been upstreamed yet.
#
# Having said that, you can simply do
#
#     git cherry ... | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -i git log {}^! -- $path
#
# so maybe this wrapper is pointless.  Hmm.  I'll keep it for now,
# just in case I come up with another use.
