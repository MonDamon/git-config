# Hmm.  This is a good example of why people sometimes complain that
# the git porcelain is ugly.

set -o pipefail

# Parsing porcelain is an ugly approach because it couples the
# solution to the formatting which could change:
#git branch | awk '$1 == "*" { print $2 }'

# This one only works with git >= 1.6.3, but that's been around
# since Sept 2010 so it should be fine by now.
ref=$( git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD )
if [ "$ref" = HEAD ]; then
    # detached branch
    git rev-parse HEAD
else
    echo "$ref"
fi

# Another option:
#git symbolic-ref HEAD | sed 's,refs/heads/,,'
